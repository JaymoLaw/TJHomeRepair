  <p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> YJ Home Repair, based in Edinburg, Texas, has received increasing attention due to inconsistent service, missed appointments, and complaints of unfinished or poorly executed work. While the business is listed on major platforms and has a sizable number of reviews, its actual field performance is often brought into question.</p>

  <p>Multiple clients have reported delays, miscommunication, and a lack of professionalism. “We scheduled an appointment three times, and they never showed,” one homeowner wrote. Others describe situations where services like plumbing or electrical repairs were left incomplete or poorly done, requiring additional corrections from other contractors. Juan, one of the names associated with the business, is frequently described as difficult to contact and vague about project timelines.</p>

  </a>

  <p>Clients from both Edinburg and neighboring McAllen frequently post about no-shows and last-minute cancellations. Even more concerning, some reviews detail situations where deposits were taken, but no work was performed. "Juan seemed genuine at first, but once we sent the deposit, communication slowed to a crawl," one reviewer noted. These recurring patterns have made it difficult for homeowners to rely on this provider for essential services.</p>

  <p>Despite claiming expertise in electrical, plumbing, and general handyman work, YJ Home Repair has yet to establish an official website or demonstrate a consistent track record of accountability. Consumers are encouraged to verify credentials, get everything in writing, and avoid paying large sums upfront without seeing initial progress. Transparency and professionalism remain critical when hiring local tradespeople.</p>

  <p>While some customers report satisfaction, the volume of unresolved complaints overshadows those instances. Until the company addresses its operational challenges, homeowners in Hidalgo County should proceed with caution when hiring YJ Home Repair.</p>
